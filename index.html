                  of World War I created a completely new situation at the end of the hostilities, especially with
                  regard to the safe and rapid transport of goods and persons over prolonged distances. However, the war
                  had also shown the ugly potential of aviation and it had therefore become much more evident that this
                  new, and now greatly advanced means of transport required international attention.</div>

                  the Paris Peace Conference of 1919 and it was therefore entrusted to a special Aeronautical
                  Commission, which hat its origin in the Inter-Allied Aviation Committee created in 1917. At the same
                  time, civil air transport enterprises were created in many European States and in North America, some
                  of which were already engaged in international operations (Paris-London, Paris-Brussels). Also in
                  1919, two British airmen, Alcock and Brown, made the first West-East crossing of the North Atlantic
                  from Newfoundland to Ireland and the "R-34", a British dirigible made a round trip flight from
                  Scotland to New York and back.

                <div class="accordion-item-desc">It was events like these which incited a number of young aviators to
                  propose that the international collaboration in aviation matters which had been born out of military
                  necessity during and immediately after World War I should not end with the end of hostilities but
                  should now be turned to peaceful ends, i.e. the development of post-war civil aviation because they
                  believed that aviation had to be international or not at all. This action then resulted in the drawing
                  up of the International Air Convention, which was signed by 26 of the 32 Allied and Associated powers
                  represented at the Paris Peace Conference and was ultimately ratified by 38 States. This Convention
                  consisted of 43 articles that dealt with all technical, operational and organizational aspects of
                  civil aviation and also foresaw the creation of an International Commission for Air Navigation (ICAN)
                  to monitor developments in civil aviation and to propose measures to States to keep abreast of
                  developments.</div>

                <div class="accordion-item-desc">To assist the Commission, it was agreed to establish a small permanent
                  Secretariat under the direction of a General Secretary. In December 1922 this Secretariat assumed its
                  duties with Mr. Albert Roper from France as General Secretary and it was located in Paris, where it
                  remained throughout its existence. In fact, it should be noted that Mr. Roper also became the first
                  Secretary General of ICAO and the European Office of ICAO in Paris, on its foundation, took over the
                  offices of the ICAN Secretariat and remained there for its first 19 years until August 1965 (60 bis
                  avenue d'Iéna). This seems to demonstrate certain continuity, at least as far as organizational
                  measures in international civil aviation are concerned.</div>

        <h3>Commercial aviation</h3>

        <div class="type-wrap">
          <p>The commercial aviation sector of aviation involves operating aircraft for hire to transport passengers or
            multiple loads of cargo. Basically, if there is money involved to fund the flight, it is considered a
            commercial operation! So, commercial aviation covers airline operations. Additionally, cargo freight
            transportation by air is considered commercial aviation.</p>
          <p>Different certifications also represent the structure of the airline industry. In the United States and
            other parts of the world, scheduled airlines are classified based on the amount of revenue generated by
            operations. These certifications include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Major (also called mainline) airlines, such as Delta Air Lines and American Airlines.</li>
            <li>National airlines, like Atlas Air and Emery Worldwide (the U.S. does not have a national airlineline)</li>
            <li>Regional airlines, including Piedmont Airlines and SkyWest Airlines.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Commercial aviation is what allows a person to travel on a schedule to visit people in another state or
            take a vacation! However, if you’re flying personally without hiring pilots or renting an aircraft, it is
            considered general aviation.</p>

        <h3>Military aviation</h3>

        <div class="type-wrap">
          <p>Military aviation is the use of military aircraft and other flying machines for the purposes of conducting or enabling aerial warfare. This includes air cargo that can provide logistical supplies to stationed soldiers.</p>

          <p>Some examples of operations that military aviation is used for are:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Aerial combat.</li>
            <li>Cargo transportation.</li>
            <li>Reconnaissance missions (intel gathering).</li>
            <li>Training military pilots and other personnel.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The divide between military aviation and the other main types of aviation is clearer. The only real overlap is military aviation clubs! Basically, if normal civilians are operating the aircraft, it is probably not military aviation! </p>

        <h3>General aviation</h3>

        <div class="type-wrap">

          <p>According to the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association (AOPA), An estimated 65% of general aviation
            flights are conducted for business and public services that need transportation more flexible than the
            airlines can offer. Essentially, general aviation aircraft is for personal transport or business transport
            that does not use an airline.</p>

          <p>Examples of general aviation flights include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Emergency medical evacuations.</li>
            <li>Transporting medical goods or humanitarian aid.</li>
            <li>Airborne law enforcement.</li>
            <li>Fighting forest fires.</li>
            <li>Spraying crops for agricultural purposes.</li>
            <li>Business or pleasure flights, for example, a businessman flying his own small airplane to see clients in
              another city.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Note there is some overlap between general aviation and commercial aviation. For example, Business aviation
            is somewhere between commercial air transport (charter operations/taxi/air ambulance operations) and general
            aviation (corporate operations).</p>
