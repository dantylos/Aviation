                <div class="accordion-item-desc">Needless to say that the technical developments in aviation arising out of World War I created a completely new situation at the end of the hostilities, especially with regard to the safe and rapid transport of goods and persons over prolonged distances. However, the war had also shown the ugly potential of aviation and it had therefore become much more evident that this new, and now greatly advanced means of transport required international attention.</div>

                <div class="accordion-item-desc">For obvious reasons, the treatment of aviation matters was a subject at the Paris Peace Conference of 1919 and it was therefore entrusted to a special Aeronautical Commission, which hat its origin in the Inter-Allied Aviation Committee created in 1917. At the same time, civil air transport enterprises were created in many European States and in North America, some of which were already engaged in international operations (Paris-London, Paris-Brussels). Also in 1919, two British airmen, Alcock and Brown, made the first West-East crossing of the North Atlantic from Newfoundland to Ireland and the "R-34", a British dirigible made a round trip flight from Scotland to New York and back.

                <div class="accordion-item-desc">It was events like these which incited a number of young aviators to propose that the international collaboration in aviation matters which had been born out of military necessity during and immediately after World War I should not end with the end of hostilities but should now be turned to peaceful ends, i.e. the development of post-war civil aviation because they believed that aviation had to be international or not at all. This action then resulted in the drawing up of the International Air Convention, which was signed by 26 of the 32 Allied and Associated powers represented at the Paris Peace Conference and was ultimately ratified by 38 States. This Convention consisted of 43 articles that dealt with all technical, operational and organizational aspects of civil aviation and also foresaw the creation of an International Commission for Air Navigation (ICAN) to monitor developments in civil aviation and to propose measures to States to keep abreast of developments.</div>

                <div class="accordion-item-desc">To assist the Commission, it was agreed to establish a small permanent Secretariat under the direction of a General Secretary. In December 1922 this Secretariat assumed its duties with Mr. Albert Roper from France as General Secretary and it was located in Paris, where it remained throughout its existence. In fact, it should be noted that Mr. Roper also became the first Secretary General of ICAO and the European Office of ICAO in Paris, on its foundation, took over the offices of the ICAN Secretariat and remained there for its first 19 years until August 1965 (60 bis avenue d'IÃ©na). This seems to demonstrate certain continuity, at least as far as organizational measures in international civil aviation are concerned.</div>
